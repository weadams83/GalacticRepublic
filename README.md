# sprint-2-final-galactic-republic

For this assessment students will work in a group(s) to write a full stack application. This will incorporate everything we learned in the classroom. Students will be given tasks across the full stack to ensure everyone works on all pieces of the application. The application will be managed in a simulated kan ban agile style and will make use of Github issues and the project board. During the first day of the assessment students will gather requirements with their techlead from stakeholders and begin designing and setting up the structure of their application. The target for the first week is to finish version 1.0 of their application.Friday afternoon students will present their final projects as a tech-demo for the "stakeholders" of the application.
